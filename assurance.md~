Strategies followed to ensure we met client spec:
 - Verification
 - Validation

Strategies followed to ensure our code worked:
 - Throughout the process we are making sure that the code on the master branch 
 always contains correct and functional code, and only pushing to master once we 
 have done proficient testing od the function being pushed.
 - Each team member will have their own branch to work from allowing multiple
 people to work on the same files if necessary. 
 - We also used python3-coverage in order to check whether our tests 
 comprehensively tested the functions being written.
